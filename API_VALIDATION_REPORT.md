## Data Source Verification

### 1. **User Profile Data** ✅
- **Source**: `users` table
- **Status**: All fields retrieved correctly from database
- Includes: personal info, verification status, preferences

### 2. **Country Data** ✅
- **Source**: `countries` table (JOIN)
- **Status**: Correctly resolved via `country_id` relationship
- Returns: `{ id: 125, name: "Nigeria" }`

### 3. **Followers Count** ✅
- **Source**: `follows` table
- **Query**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follows WHERE following_id = ?`
- **Result**: 2 users are following this user

### 4. **Following Count** ✅
- **Source**: `follows` table
- **Query**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM follows WHERE follower_id = ?`
- **Result**: This user is following 2 other users

### 5. **Bonds Count** ✅
- **Source**: `bonds_users` table
- **Query**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bonds_users WHERE user_id = ?`
- **Result**: User is a member of 3 bonds

### 6. **Activities Count** ✅ (FIXED)
- **Source**: Multiple activity tables (UNION query)
  - `activity_participants` - Regular participants
  - `activity_co_organizers` - Co-organizers
  - `activities.creator_id` - Activities created by user
- **Query**: UNION of all three sources with DISTINCT count
- **Result**: User is participating in/organizing 3 activities
- **Previous Issue**: Was querying non-existent `activity_attendees` table (500 error)
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to correct table names

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Activities Count Query
**File**: `/src/modules/user/user.service.ts`

**Before** (causing 500 error):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id) as count 
FROM activity_attendees 
WHERE user_id = ?
```

**After** (working correctly):
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id) as count FROM (
  SELECT activity_id FROM activity_participants WHERE user_id = ?
  UNION
  SELECT activity_id FROM activity_co_organizers WHERE user_id = ?
  UNION
  SELECT id as activity_id FROM activities WHERE creator_id = ?
) AS user_activities
```

### 2. Updated Response DTO Documentation
**File**: `/src/modules/user/dto/user-response.dto.ts`

Added missing fields and proper Swagger documentation:
- `phone_verified` - Phone verification status
- `gender` - User gender
- `role` - User role (user/admin)
- Added `@ApiProperty` decorators to all exposed fields

---

## Conclusion

✅ **All data is authentic and accurately retrieved from your database**

✅ **No fabricated or placeholder data**

✅ **API is fully functional after the fix**

✅ **Swagger documentation now matches actual response**
