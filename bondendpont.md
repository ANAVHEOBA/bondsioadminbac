I'll analyze the activity controller to identify all the endpoints and then suggest what would be needed for the bond module. Let me examine the activity controller first.

Now let me check the existing bonds controller to see what's already implemented:

Now let me check the bonds entity to understand the structure:

Based on my analysis of the activity controller and the existing bonds controller, here's a comprehensive list of endpoints that would be needed for the **Bond Module** to match the activity module's functionality:

## **üìä STATISTICS & ANALYTICS**

### **Basic Statistics**
- `GET /admin/bond/stats` - Bond statistics (total bonds, active, hidden, public/private, member counts, etc.)

### **Advanced Analytics** 
- `GET /admin/bond/analytics` - Detailed bond analytics (popular locations, engagement metrics, top creators, trends)

## **üîç SEARCH & FILTERING**

### **Advanced Search**
- `GET /admin/bond/search` - Advanced search with full-text search and filters (name, location, creator, visibility, member count ranges, etc.)

### **List/Filter**
- `GET /admin/bond/list` - List/filter all bonds (already exists but may need enhancement)
- `GET /admin/bond/trending` - Get trending bonds

## **üë• CREATOR MANAGEMENT**

### **By Creator**
- `GET /admin/bond/by-creator/:userId` - Get all bonds by specific creator

### **Top Creators**
- `GET /admin/bond/creators/top` - Get top bond creators by count/engagement (similar to what we just implemented for activities)

## **üìÖ TIME-BASED FILTERING**

### **Recent/Active Bonds**
- `GET /admin/bond/recent` - Recently created bonds
- `GET /admin/bond/active` - Most active bonds (by member activity, posts, etc.)

## **üîç SINGLE BOND MANAGEMENT**

### **Bond Details**
- `GET /admin/bond/:id` - Single bond details (enhanced admin view)

### **Bond Actions**
- `DELETE /admin/bond/:id` - Permanently delete a bond
- `PATCH /admin/bond/:id/hide` - Hide bond
- `PATCH /admin/bond/:id/unhide` - Unhide bond

## **üë• MEMBER MANAGEMENT**

### **Member Lists**
- `GET /admin/bond/:id/members` - Get detailed member list with user info (similar to activity participants)
- `PATCH /admin/bond/:id/remove-member` - Remove specific member from bond

## **üìä REPORTS MANAGEMENT**

### **Report Statistics**
- `GET /admin/bond/reports/stats` - Get report statistics (similar to activity reports)

### **Report Lists**
- `GET /admin/bond/reports/pending` - Get only pending reports (already partially exists)
- `GET /admin/bond/reports` - View all bond reports (already exists)

### **Report Actions**
- `PATCH /admin/bond/reports/:reportId/status` - Update report status (already exists)

## **üéØ MISSING ENDPOINTS (Compared to Activity Module)**

Based on the activity controller, these are the **key missing endpoints** in the bonds module:

### **üî• High Priority Missing:**
1. **`GET /admin/bond/stats`** - Basic bond statistics
2. **`GET /admin/bond/analytics`** - Advanced bond analytics  
3. **`GET /admin/bond/search`** - Advanced search functionality
4. **`GET /admin/bond/by-creator/:userId`** - Bonds by specific creator
5. **`GET /admin/bond/creators/top`** - Top bond creators
6. **`GET /admin/bond/:id/members`** - Detailed member management
7. **`GET /admin/bond/trending`** - Trending bonds
8. **`GET /admin/bond/reports/stats`** - Report statistics
9. **`GET /admin/bond/reports/pending`** - Pending reports only
10. **`DELETE /admin/bond/:id`** - Delete bond
11. **`PATCH /admin/bond/:id/hide`** - Hide bond
12. **`PATCH /admin/bond/:id/unhide`** - Unhide bond

### **üìà Bond-Specific Enhancements:**
- **Member activity tracking** (posts, interactions within bonds)
- **Bond growth analytics** (member acquisition over time)
- **Interest-based analytics** (popular interests in bonds)
- **Geographic distribution** of bonds
- **Engagement metrics** (member retention, activity levels)

The bonds module currently has basic listing and reporting functionality, but lacks the comprehensive admin analytics, search capabilities, and management features that the activity module provides.
